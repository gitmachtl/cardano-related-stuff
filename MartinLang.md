## Stuff that i have created / Projects i am working on 

Here are a handful of things i am working on:

- ### Cardano Signer [(Link)](https://github.com/gitmachtl/cardano-signer) 
<img width=50% src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47434720/190806957-114b1342-7392-4256-9c5b-c65fc0068659.png">
Cardano Signer is the only Open-Source Multi-OS (Linux, Mac, Windows, Arm) Command-Line Tool that can Sign, Verify & Generate a lot of Cardano related things like:<p></p>

  - CIP8/30 Message-Signing and Verification for ALL different keys on Cardano
  - Calidus Key Generation, Verification and Registration-Data signing CIP88v2/151
  - General ed25519 Signing and Verification
  - Key Generation from Mnemonics from Byron Daedalus, Byron Yoroi, Shelley 12-24 Words, Ledger Hardware-Wallet, Trezor Hardware-Wallet style derivation
  - Key Generation for Payment, Staking, Pool, dRep, CC-Hot, CC-Cold, Calidus keys
  - Catalyst Registration Signing CIP36
  - Governance Metadata Signing, Verification and Canonization CIP100/108/119/136
  - etc ...

Cardano Signer is used by multiple other tools and platforms, one of the most prominent and recent ones are for example:

  - Used by the Ekklesia Multi-Vote/Poll tool
  - Used for the Intersect CC Candidate Poll Platform
  - Used to sign the Messages on the Midnight Glacier Drop Website (its the only tool that can sign for Byron-Wallets)
  - Used in CN-Tools and SPO-Scripts
  - and many more ...

<p>&nbsp;</p>

- ### StakePool Operator Scripts [(Link)]()

I have created the first SPO Scripts during the ITN Testnet phase, they evolved over the time and got more and more features. The root cause was to provide other devs and Pool Operators source code they can look into if they wanna build something on there own. Or just use them as they are. Over the time they got a lot of features, they were also the first Script Suite that supported a "Light-Mode" on the CLI without a Cardano-Node requirement. Here are a few things you can do with the SPO Scripts:<p></p>

  - Work in Full-Online (Cardano-Node), Light- or Offline-Mode
  - Send Funds from Wallets to Wallets with full Hardware-Wallet Support
  - Send Native Assets from Wallets with full Hardware-Wallet Support
  - Claim Staking rewards from CLI and Hardware-Wallets
  - Generate Keys on the CLI in plain or encrypted format
  - Generate Keys on via Hardware-Wallets
  - Register, Update and Retire a Cardano Stakepool with all the needed Keys on CLI or Hardware-Wallet
  - Register, Delegate and Retire a Stakeaddresses on CLI or Hardware-Wallet
  - Create Mint or Remove Burn Native Assets
  - Create the needed signed registration files for the Cardano Native Asset Registry
  - Create and Check Calidus-PoolKeys
  - Create, Register, Check and Retire dRep-Keys
  - Generate and Check Voting-Power Delegation
  - Create, Register, Check and Retire Constitutional-Committee HOT and COLD Keys
  - Vote and query on Governance-Actions
  - Create Governance-Actions (all 7 different styles)
  - and much more ...
