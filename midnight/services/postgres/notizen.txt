# Install script from
https://cardano-community.github.io/guild-operators/Appendix/postgres/

and also follow the other instruction there to generate the PGPASSFILE for the current user

* For the direct db-sync connection we use the PGPASSFILE environment variable for the user that is
also running db-sync. In that case there is no password needed.

Follow the guidance on the following page to create the db-sync database
https://cardano-community.github.io/guild-operators/Build/dbsync/


#To create an additional superuser with a password for other services we can do the following
#We need that for the midnight-node postgres calling line

#change user to be the postgres user
$ sudo su postgres

#connect to postgres
$ psql

#to show all databases
postgres=# \l 

#to list all users
postgres=# \du

#to create a new user 'dbuser' with password 'dbpass'
postgres=# CREATE USER dbuser WITH PASSWORD 'dbpass';
postgres=# ALTER ROLE dbuser WITH SUPERUSER;
postgres=# ALTER ROLE dbuser WITH CREATEDB;

#to exit
postgres=# \q
